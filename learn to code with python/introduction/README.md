### Building Fantasy Quest

We're going to build a text-based adventure game called "Fantasy Quest" in this course! I've written the first line of code for you, it prints a message below the editor welcoming new players to the game.

**Submit** the code to pass this assignment, then click the **-->** right arrow.

### Fix Your First Bug

The combat system in Fantasy Quest isn't working as intended! It appears that players are gaining health when attacked instead of losing it.

### Assignment
Fix the math bug on line 3.

## The Console

The "console" is a panel that displays important messages, like errors or the text output of a program. If we want to see what's happening in our code, we need to print it to the console by using the ** print() ** function.

We'll learn more about functions later, but for now, just know that the **print()** function will print anything you put inside its parentheses. For example:

```bash
print("this is some example text to print")
```

### Assignment
We need to tell our new players how to move! Print the following text to the console:

```
Use the arrow keys to move
