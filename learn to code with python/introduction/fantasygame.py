#Shop Response
#Our dev team has been making updates to Fantasy Quest's innkeeper shop. But there's a problem! The Innkeeper's text dialogue is empty!
#Assignment(Add 2 separate print statements to complete the Innkeeper's response. They should say the following:)

print("Ah! Great choices...")
print("Is there anything else I can help you with?")
