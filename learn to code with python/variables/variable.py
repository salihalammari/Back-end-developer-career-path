#Assignment We need to keep track of our hero's health! On the first line of code, create a new variable named player_health and set it equal to 1000.

#player_health = 1000 
# don't touch below this line

print(player_health)


#Assignment
#We need to reduce our hero's health as they take damage.
#Before each print() function in the provided code, change the value of player_health to 100 less than it was before.
#The final output should look like this:
```bash
900
800
700
600
```
#player_health = 1000

# reduce by 100 here

#player_health = 100
#print(player_health)

# and here
player_health = 900
print(player_health)

# and here
player_health = 800
print(player_health)

# and here
player_health = 700
print(player_health)

# and here
player_health = 600
print(player_health)
